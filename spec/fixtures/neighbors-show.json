I am the lead engineer.\r\n\r\nWhat if we knew what people wanted in their neighborhoods? That question was the genesis of Neighborland, and it continues to fascinate me. I believe that when residents have a simple way to make their neighborhoods better, amazing things will happen.\r\n\r\nI love to build tools to make people more creative and productive. I want it to be easy and fun to make communities better.\r\n\r\nWhen not programming computers, I enjoy snowboarding, tennis, urban cycling, and the tasty things, like a classic espresso or a Colorado craft beer.\r\n\r\nLet's make our neighborhoods better. Share your ideas & make it happen!","website":"","twitter_username":"teeparham","facebook_url":"","avatar_medium_url":"https://d30wms7jgjmff8.cloudfront.net/avatars/1/medium.JPG?1321728952","city":{"id":"bldr","url":"https://neighborland.com/api/v1/cities/bldr","alternate_url":"https://neighborland.com/cities/bldr","name":"Boulder","state":"CO"},"neighborhood":{"id":"bldr-north","url":"https://neighborland.com/api/v1/neighborhoods/bldr-north","alternate_url":"https://neighborland.com/neighborhoods/bldr-north","name":"North Boulder"}}
