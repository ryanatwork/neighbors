One simple way that people can oppose ideas is to comment \"I oppose this.\" Since there is a \"me too\" button on every comment, other neighbors can join you in opposition.\n\nSo hopefully there is already a way to do what you asked.

I agree with his major points. GitHub is not only a super product that I use every day, but an innovative company that I personally am inspired by. To me, \"open API\" means two things. One: you can get all data on Neighborland for free via the API. Two: you can build an app using the API to do anything you can do on the site itself. On the technical side, we will provide JSON via REST with clear documentation in order to make things as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nWe are building a basic reference implementation client application that will be open source. On the other end of the spectrum, we will have a widget builder that generates javascript to copy & paste into any site.\r\n\r\nThanks for your questions and support. We will have a more formal announcement along these lines soon.","support_count":1,"created_at":"2012-08-03T23:12:02-06:00","neighbor":{"id":"tee","url":"https://neighborland.com/api/v1/neighbors/tee","alternate_url":"https://neighborland.com/neighbors/tee","name":"Tee Parham","username":"tee","avatar_thumb_url":"https://d30wms7jgjmff8.cloudfront.net/avatars/1/thumb.JPG?1321728952"}}]
